  "transcript": "I'd like to welcome to the studio this week's author of the week. Alexey Talandor. And we're lucky enough to have him here in the studio to answer a few questions. Fluent from Antarctica. It was quite a hardship. Can you tell our readers a little bit about how you first got interested in writing and what made you want to become a writer? Well, I mainly started with reading as I think probably all writers started that way with lots of reading. I basically have until like the age of 12, I didn't read much at all. until like the age of 12, I didn't read much at all. And then a teacher of mine in high school got me onto a specific author, Willard Price's name is. And then I just started reading a lot from there. And I think it was when I started reading Stephen King. And mainly reading books where he had the one meaning character was a writer that had really got me interested in writing, I think, just the whole process of what the writer did in writing and how he got into it. And I think just with the stories that King came up with, got me interested in thinking. with got me into it and thinking, you know, maybe I could just spin something like that, come up with some cool story. Cool. Yeah. Was there a specific king book you remember in particular being influential? Influential. Thank you. Not really. I mean, the dark path made a big impression. Right. That was a good one about a writer. Also, I personally, I liked it quite a bit. That was another good writer. A bit too long though. Too long. Okay. Fair enough. Yeah. It was like 600 pages per letter. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So and next I know readers are And next, I know readers are always interested in knowing how writers do what they do. And it would be great if you could just magically push a button or if you had a computer program that would give you the nice turns of phrase and all that thing. But unfortunately, we don't have that yet. So we actually have to create. I don't have that like that. That might suck. But so can you tell our readers a little bit about how you write? Do you have a schedule? Do you write every day? What kind of discipline do you? Ideally, if I was doing... ideally if I was doing this full time I would have this perfect schedule you know like all successful writers have where I've read at certain times of the day and enjoy the other parts but because I'm full time employed in retail I have a very weird schedule that I know I know when I'm gonna be working yeah so the best I can do is I have to the days I get off is are my big writing time that's the time I feel the guilt kicking where like I'm not doing anything today so today the time I should be writing yeah but it really Yeah. But it really varies with what I'm working on. If it's something I'm really interested in, even if I've had a tough day at work and I'm tired, all of a sudden I'll want to write and be able to write that evening regardless of how tired I am. Okay, that's great. So you say that guilt plays a big role. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, okay. Last one I don't write at all, I start to get weird. Okay. I start to feel the something missing in my life and I'm doing something right and it is, it's because I'm not writing. So anyway, you mentioned in that last answer, you were talking about a novel that you're working on right now. Mm-hmm. novel that you're working on right now. I hadn't asked about this before but I was wondering if you'd like to talk a little bit about which is our work. Nothing is an accident and it started accidentally, funnily enough. Basically I mean the little I had read quite a bit of Dean Coons not lately because he's really gone downhill. I would agree with that. Four or five books ago I read a lot of him and I was just always impressed with how he really wouldn't have too much background. He just start his stories would just start with the guy and just go from there and that's true. That's true. That's true. That's true. from there and we really looked back much and I was really impressed with how like, wow, he's just going with this. A lot of momentum. Yeah, just going with it. And so I wanted to try a story like that. So I thought I'd just start it out. And it starts out with a guy who basically wakes up in a room. Doesn't remember anything about himself or who he is or anything like that. And then it kind of goes from there. He turns out he's in a house. But then it turns out this house is actually part of his, basically a facility sort of a lab almost like he's like a pig type thing and turns out this. pig type thing and turns out there's this agency behind it all. There's like training him for something. But they're able to control like mind wiping and stuff like that and giving him an knee just so that's why he doesn't remember who he is or anything like that. But that way they control him better and... Sounds like it touches on a theme that you find keeps returning to your writing to some degree which you've mentioned before. You were talking about strangers in strange lands or people coming into situations where they... They... into situations where they find that they're not exactly at home. Do you want to talk about that a little bit? Well, it's kind of freaky actually because when I got that question, I hadn't really... I mean, I thought I'd had a bid before but actually then decided to take it all my writing apart and actually just see it was all there which was kind of freaky where... because I mean, I was bored in Spain and raised there for 18 years and then I came over here for college by a weird accident where I got terrible grades in school and so college in University Handners punishment. University in there's punishment in England wasn't an option right because nowhere would take me until I was Or kind of like Australia my second plan. I've always wanted to come here And all you need is a high school deployments and decent grades and plus they love international students So especially from so far reaches is Spain, you know So I started with that and so I've never really felt at home anywhere. I don't think my mom's British my dad's Swedish so and basically Spain was a vacation spot for them. So that's why they move of vacation spot for them so that's why they move there and it's just like nowhere I've really ever called home per se. I would call Kelth one of my home now just because I've been here so long. Right. But yeah just having moved all around a lot I think alienation will be the verb I would choose. And just like you know I guess that that shows up a lot in my writing and the different novels I've done where the characters never feel they necessarily belong where they are and want to be somewhere else in this case they... somewhere else. In this case they don't know where they are but they definitely feel lost and trying to find that. So maybe one day I'll find the book that will have the answer. Be like, oh, so that's where I'm from and that's what I'm all about. Now I don't have to write anymore. Now I don't. But it also kind of ties in with a head up professor in college by an Alan Lane who he basically said that you know there are three questions writers are always trying to answer. They usually fit into one of these groups which is where are we from? Where are we now? from where are we now in the present and where are we going? So you know a lot of sci-fi writers will do the where are we going thing for the future. And I've always been very interested in history and specific medieval history and then anything before 1500 is what I like basically. And so and I've always been interested in anthropology and looking back and clearly there you can see that I'm wanting to try to answer where do we come from. Right. Right. And the best reason I can come up for me liking the medieval period. up for me liking the medieval period, even though I'm not a fan of religion so much and there's so much religion in it, is I think that after the fall of Rome, you know, Western society pretty much collapsed and they had to redo it. Yeah. Do the whole thing all over again so they had to reinvent it. And because we have more evidence from that period than we do, you know, pre-8000 BC or whatever, that way we can find out more. And like, yeah, the history books, I mean, I pick up anything if it's like to do with anthropology or anything. It's like to do with anthropology, Jared Diamond's one of the period authors comes germs and steels. The book, the entire world should read and that way they know why we're so screwed up right now. You've already got one more person having read it. I just finished the excellent book. I agree. If you haven't read Guns and Steel. The grain seeds and stuff like that. I get a little slow, but overall you get to understand why the world is a lot the way it is. Yeah, it's like it's fiber for every reader. Yeah, any books that kind of touch on our history. Especially up-to-date ones because I mean... up to date ones because I mean we're totally we're changing our ideas all the time with new evidence that comes out right and I'm trying to what's the one I mentioned in the written interview oh the admissible sec but they were totally like with new evidence changing the ideas of how yeah yeah the image of the the cave man who goes out and gets the food while the women stay at home and new evidence has kind of shown that that's totally not the case that the women were just as involved as the man stuff like two guys attacking Stuff like two guys attacking wool and mammoths probably never happened unless there was a attack in the cave because It's a giant creature that would have killed everyone. Yeah What was more likely happening was they were attacking smaller creatures like walls and pigs and things like that And they were doing it as a group and using nets and things like that instead of spears and Just like it really enlightening us to how it probably was more accurately right, right? okay, and You mentioned also some science fiction there. Do you have any? some science fiction there. Do you have any favorite science fiction authors or anything you'd like to talk about? Ray Bradbury I have read and It's great. He's just not even just as a sci-fi writer. He's just one of the best writers of our time I think and just in in the story he's able to do so much. Right Yeah, I actually one of my favorite sci-fi novels I haven't reread it recently, but it's called Coyote by Alan Steele. Okay, no matter what I go and I got a free copy side of this a while ago and I got a free copy so I decided to read it and it was a great just like your classic sci-fi where you go that civilization that you know wants to colonize and so they move to they go many many thousands of light years away and and colonize this other planet and but they go through the steps like back on earth is actually they end up as a like a rebel group that actually steals the ship that's supposed to colonize it and so then they cover you know spending the thousands of light years crossing the they're in stasis 2s but except for one guy who stases 2 breaks yeah one guy who's tasted two breaks and so they go into the story of how he's on his own in the ship. No one else around him for you know the rest of his life and how he's like goes crazy. Right. And then they cover the whole you know settling the planet and things like that. Maybe you could tell us about the story that is appearing on the website this week and how that came about. Wow. Well actually I think wrote it in 98 I'm gonna say. Okay. He used to be all uh really organized and put fancy copyright dates on everything. put fancy copyright dates on everything, just like you know, when, but I don't know if I still have that one on that one, but I'm pretty sure it was 98. Right. I don't remember much else about it, just that I wanted to do a story maybe about, you know, to do the death character and change it up a little. Right. And it was actually that was 98, actually it was 98, because that was the only year and that's why I didn't even show up. Ah, yeah, you did show enough. And it sounds a state that year and. What are aspects of what's something that when you're reading you will never with any إلى nir tj r hier... you'll never remember when I leaving life just for the two to give us a one. You know. when you're reading a writer that just makes you stop and say wow that was good. Honestly, and then I've talked about this with my wife because she's also a big reader and a writer. And she's much more on character and I'm much more the plot story get. Plot, okay, right. So it's definitely I think description and a turn of phrase. Shave on is pretty masterful of this. Oh yes, yeah. And his use of how, when he uses metaphors and similes and how he'll continue the simileon you know through the paragraph and actually make it tie into the stories. and actually make it tie into the story somehow, which doesn't sound forced and is just brilliant and I hate him for that. Yeah, he's just wonderful with all his metaphors and language, just jumped off the page at you. Yeah, I've never been sure if it's actually, how much he works at it, because Irving just like, you know, plines everything out first and then writes the hell out of it for three years until he's got it just perfect as you know, any peening. Yes, I want to shave on just because he is so good how much work. just because he is so good how much work he puts into it. Right. How much he gets right straight away and things like that. Yeah, yeah. There's a different, slightly different focus between someone like John Irving, who is also a great stylistic writer. Probably definitely not. But probably there's a little bit more of a focus on the plotting and things in John Irving's character. Not really characters, or just... You're probably always going to come back to some degree to character being important to the story, because if you don't care about the characters and it's hard to care about what's happening to them, care about what's happening to them. But so you mentioned Shabon, is there anyone else recently that you've read that you think is a great writer that people should go out and reach? I pulled up my website and to see what I've recently. Okay. Yeah, when you talk a little bit about it. Also talk about how you review books and where. Well, yeah, I put all my reviews on my website too. Okay. AlexCTelander.com. I went there and maybe I said it was pronounced. I went there and they said it was pronounced. They did, did it. Yeah, they did, yeah. Is that what it told me? It's a web 2.0 thing. But anyway, yeah, to repeat, AlexeCylander.com. What you got? If you're not sure, there's just check out my name on this website at ad.com. Which we will spell correct. I've basically been putting up like, yeah, book reviews there. I've linked my blog, which I don't update so much anymore, because I'm working on this website. I do this thing. I basically update every two weeks now, and I try to do that. I think I've been updated every two weeks now and I try to do a thing called stream of consciousness. Okay. Yeah, which I suggest a little thing probably 500 or 1000 where it's tops and it's like just something I felt like writing. Yeah, I just do it's further moment and it's be interested in to see what will come out and do you ever know about, have a whole ton of these and maybe one day I'll look back and make a book out of it. But then I also do book reviews for bookloons.com. Okay. What's that in case our readers aren't familiar? It's just a nice big fan. Not familiar. It's just a nice big fancy website that does I think that got like hundreds Less thousands of book reviews now like 8,000 book reviews and they actually have a really big readership to I discovered Okay, but yeah, I mean there's a there's about five to ten of us that do reviews and yeah, we just Cool, all right to check that out that's bookloons.com. Is that correct? Yes, okay? No Hyponase and nothing just straight there I've been a dot now, but no, it's definitely dot com but no, it's definitely dot com. Okay, the real one. I'm like this one. Nothing. We used to be dot com, but it was late late show mag, the late late show magazine dot com. There's not like that, it's really unwieldy and people, you know, got tired of when I would tell them. So then I found late late show dot had, it was much more to the point. So you do some book reviewing, you do a little bit of, a lot of bit of novel writing, a little bit of short story writing. We just say, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I used to do a lot more now. I used to do a lot more because I'm working on just much bigger projects. I have less short stories ideas. I guess because my ideas are just so much bigger. I did write one last year. I don't do too many anymore. But they idea gets me out and do a short story. You also mentioned working on multiple projects at the same time. Is that something that you're comfortable doing or do you have a critical point which you can't sustain? I actually wondered for what other writers do. actually wondered for a while what other writers do and just wondering if you know you're because it puts so much emphasis on you know finishing that novel do you just work on that one novel then and but I found out that again to site Stephen King this they don't do that lots of people have multiple novels and different things going out at the same time I think erring again he does a lot of screenplay work as well so he has different things going out at the same time and I think that way otherwise you can definitely get burned out on something and right or get stuck at it and you know want to leave it for a while or get stuck at it and you know, want to leave it for a while and then come back to it. So yeah, another thing I'm working on right now, which is still trying to get up and go on, is a graphic novel series, all to do with the battle hastings. Uh-huh, very cool. And it basically just opens with the battle about to start and then we'll go back and find out all the history of the characters and what leads up to it. And then, I mean, I just basically wanted to do a story, the graphic novel series of the Bay of Tempestry basically. It basically at the end of it, it just cuts off and so even- It just cuts off and so even though Henry's dead you're not really sure what might have happened after that They think probably they showed the coronation of William and stuff like that Yes, so I thought I wanted to do a comic book series just to show that ending maybe cool Unfortunately at the moment we're trying to work with the I'm trying to work with the artist to get some stuff going I've got the script for like the first the first issue, but we're just trying to go from there Okay, it's hard when we're both working full-time in different jobs. Do you have any interest in writing nonfiction? I know you're right, Tim I know you write something. I've got, I try not to put it up when we're going to say, you know, I'm from time I'm going to do a page of basically future projects. I have planned a standpoint in the future. And the problem with nonfiction is it's going to take three to five times as much time as doing fiction. Because you do so much research and planning. But yeah, I've actually got some nonfiction books planned. I've always kind of wanted to do a story on, to do with the East India Tea Company, the old set up in that part of the world. the whole setup in that part of the world there. Just on the whole, I don't know how much there is out there available. The whole style, you know, how England is controlling it and they have this specific line of ships that were just doing the tea going back and forth from India and stuff like that. And then I've also got back in my head now to a complete history of pirates. I want to do. But not just like, you know, a specific time, but going way back to, you know, via my plan one day is to do a complete history of pirates. My plan one day is to do a complete history of pirates from going from ancient Egypt on through to the present where there are still a lot of pirates today. Cool. Not worrying the same clothes, but more on machine guns and speedboats. Right. Right. And the fishing one might say. Yeah. But it's probably going to be really long too. Yeah. Probably have to split into two additions in paperback. But then I've also got this other novel called Weird W-Y-R-D for those. That's right. It's an old English for feet. It's an old English for fate. I'm okay. But it's a set in the sixth century and I basically worked on that a bit. When was that? 2003? Got a chunk of it done. And then I left my characters basically on the British wall waiting for the Saxons to arrive. And they've been there for a while now waiting to come. And they're in my head standing there just saying, where are we going to go next? So you mentioned guilt being there. But I drive it for a few years. They've been there for a few years now and my plan is... Okay, my plan is to get back to this poll. No, be given back to this poll and take them to the next step. Well, they just kidnapped the Anglo-Saxon. It's a hangus daughter. Okay. Or we, you know, yeah, they just kidnapped her. So the Saxons are coming back because they could the daughter. And so, yeah, they need to go somewhere. And so, yeah, I'm hoping to plan to get back to that this fall. Okay. The research kind of caught up there and I needed to make sure I got things where I'm kind of working. I got things right, I'm kind of, I'm gonna work in stone hinge in that in some way. I don't know much about that, so that's why I need to read my plan to read it. Actually Edward Vutherford's Sauron. Sir, certainly. Well, and their angles, Jews and Sacks, the whole big group of them, but they've arrived and they met on this island, and then they kidnapped the daughter and skipped away in the night, and then they were, they found in the morning that the Sacks and they've also left, but they're basically going back for reinforcements. Okay. But again, this is an... Okay, all right. But again, this is another novel that again ties in with my theme that I can get rid of, which is that you've got our main character who may be Arthur, I'm not sure yet whether to make him that or not, who's been going around through Europe and then settles in England for a while with a friend. And you've got the Saxons invading England because they want Newland to settle on and trying to understand why they want to settle there. What's so important there, why they keep... want to settle there, what's so important there, why they keep settling there, and why the British feel so much patriotism and nationalism to this country, and he's trying to understand that and get behind it, because he's never felt like he's belonged. And I apparently have a big issue with that. I don't know why, but I do. That's the great part, I'm trusturing, part about writing, I'm sure, is that you get it. Hopefully now I want to start thinking about it when I write it, and then it'll become weird and... Yeah, and then you can blame me for asking that question. be obvious asking that question yeah yeah he's so self-aware he used to not be like that Chris. Well you are brought up writer's block in that which is okay right kind of a dangerous thing that people don't like to talk writers don't like to talk about it I don't have an issue with writer's block but people do and see it as like you know a thing that he who must not be named it that must not be named yeah writer's block I have no issue with it I haven't suffered from it at all and if anything I have and if anything, I'd like either the opposite part of the plot, I say, which is the thing, where if I don't write, I start to get weird and I have to write. Right. And I've never really had an issue with the writing. I mean, I guess the closest I get is I'm not sure what's going to happen next and I start trying to think and like I've, that's what I've done right now. I'm in the last part of my novel and I kind of stopped because I want to make this big ending and trying to work out how to do it and what the key is really you shouldn't think about it at all. You know, I can't stop myself from doing that. You should just... stuff and doing that. You should just sit down and write because that's the fun part of writing as the characters will do what they can because they're restricted by who they are and they'll finish it off in their way and not your way. Right. Well just to bring some cohesion to our whole conversation out there from my part. You're talking about the unconscious part of writing and the conscious part of writing that you know that you're aware of needing to have a big ending or something but then also you want to just... Also, you want to just be there on the page for the characters to sort of speak their own selves into being. How do you deal with writing and rewriting with editing? Do you just do your first draft to just let it all come out and then you shape it afterward or you want to talk about that a little bit? Yeah, and that's a good question. I mean, a lot of people will do, well, I have to edit all the way along. My wife does that as well. She can't just keep writing. She needs to edit. Perfection. image short-term brothers. You need that energy goes yeah, which is I understand of what I'm probably I guess Irving isn't like that or weird Extension of it But no, I just let it all come out put everything there I'm a big fan of that that way you're not hindering yourself at all, but then King says you need to cut out at least that's third of that Because it's all just extra stuff and that I've definitely done that before we just start being ruthless and cutting out the necessary stuff I don't know how good it is if it's Not needed in the book yet to get rid of it. Okay, so do you see you Okay, so do you see two aspects of yourself maybe coming to do battle here in writing or is it just a feel confrontational in the sense that you're having to cut things that the other part of you created and you know, part of you do. And I think that that if it was the case earlier in my career. Yeah, career use. I said, in my writing, just because there, you know, everything I worked where I wrote was great. Right. Right. Beautiful stuff. Right. You know, changed the world and I couldn't get rid of it. And I couldn't get rid of it. And, you know, basically a good time from then it's been a learning experience of, you know, you gotta cut stuff. So any plans for Fourth of July? It's an independent state today. I'm not sure, it's like 100 and something out from that side right now. It's really, really not. I'm not sure how many barbecues being had. Yeah, yeah. It's now the DACs off to help with the sound. So we've been suffering for you the listener out there. So I hope you enjoy it. You're in your drive here. during your drive, your workout? Yes, right. You can feel the sweat that we're feeling. You just clocked two miles on your workout. All right. Well, thanks for coming in now, Alex. We really appreciate it. And like to thank everyone for reading this week's story and every other story we've had recently at the late late show. We are going on hiatus as of now. So Alex, the story will be up on the site for quite a while. But hopefully we will come back at an undisclosed time in the future. So excited to be here at our next– disclose time in the future. When it cools down a little bit. Yeah, that can give you a while. But I wish you that's luck with your writing Alex and thanks again for coming in and appreciate having you at the late late show. Okay, thanks a lot and if anyone wants to drop your line about what you thought about the story, you can just go again go to my website like AlexXeediliner.com or email me at Alex at Alexeediliner.com.",
