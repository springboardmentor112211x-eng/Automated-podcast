# AutoScript AI: Automated Podcast Intelligence

AutoScript AI is an end-to-end web platform designed to transform raw podcast audio into structured, actionable intelligence. It leverages state-of-the-art Generative AI and Machine Learning models to provide high-fidelity transcriptions, executive summaries, and mathematical thematic analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **High-Fidelity Transcription**: Utilizes OpenAI's **Whisper Turbo** model for rapid and accurate speech-to-text conversion with built-in timestamp generation.
* **Abstractive Summarization**: Implements the **BART (Large-CNN)** model via Hugging Face Transformers to generate concise, human-like executive summaries.
* **Thematic Pattern Discovery**: Employs mathematical modeling techniques, including **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**, **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**, and **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**, to identify core topics within the audio.
* **Structured Timeline**: Automatically segments transcripts into chronological paragraphs with associated timestamps for easy navigation.
* **PDF Export**: Allows for professional verification and one-click export of transcripts and AI insights to PDF format.

## 🛠️ System Architecture & Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Secure upload of raw podcast audio in MP3 or WAV formats.
2. **ASR Engine**: Full-stream processing using Whisper Turbo to produce text segments.
3. **Logic Layer**: A multi-stage GenAI pipeline that handles abstractive summarization and topic segmentation.
4. **Verification**: A dedicated review interface where users can manually edit and verify AI-generated content.
5. **Responsibility**: Integration of safety filters and confidence-based fallbacks to ensure content reliability.

## 📦 Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Django 4.x
* FFmpeg (required for audio processing)
* Virtual Environment (recommended)
