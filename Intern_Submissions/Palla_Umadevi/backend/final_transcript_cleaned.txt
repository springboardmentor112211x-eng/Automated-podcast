Before we begin, I would to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research efforts this year. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to make zero-cost consumer information on science and science related tools into the general public. In keeping with that theme, I would to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012, so I am delighted that they are sponsoring the podcast. Started taking Athletic Greens, but still take out.
