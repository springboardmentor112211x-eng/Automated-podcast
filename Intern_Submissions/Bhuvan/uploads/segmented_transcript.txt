Segment 1 (0.0s - 25.52s)
 Hi, I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration, and thank you, and having

Segment 2 (25.52s - 31.04s)
 it be specific in genuine. And the way I got interested in this was I noticed in myself when I was

Segment 3 (31.04s - 35.76s)
 growing up and until about a few years ago that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want

Segment 4 (35.76s - 42.64s)
 to praise them, I'd want to take in their praise of me and I just stop it. And I asked myself why?

Segment 5 (43.36s - 49.04s)
 I felt shy, felt embarrassed, and then my question became, am I the only one who does this so I decided

Segment 6 (49.04s - 54.8s)
 to investigate? I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facilities so I get to see people who are

Segment 7 (54.8s - 59.44s)
 facing life and death with addiction. And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as

Segment 8 (60.24s - 65.76s)
 their core wound is their father died without ever saying he was proud of them. But then they hear

Segment 9 (65.76s - 70.16s)
 from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he

Segment 10 (70.16s - 75.28s)
 never told the son, it's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. So my question is,

Segment 11 (75.28s - 81.04s)
 why don't we ask for the things that we need? I know a gentleman married for 25 years who's

Segment 12 (81.12s - 85.12s)
 longing to hear his wife say thank you for being the breadwinners so I could stay home with the kids,

Segment 13 (85.12s - 90.48s)
 but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this, she wants a week meets with her husband and says,

Segment 14 (90.48s - 95.6s)
 I would like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids. And he goes

Segment 15 (95.6s - 99.92s)
 and he goes, oh, this is great, this is great. And praise really does have to be genuine, but she

Segment 16 (99.92s - 104.8s)
 takes responsibility for that in a friend of mine April who I've had since kindergarten. She thanks

Segment 17 (104.8s - 108.64s)
 her children for doing their chores. And she said, why wouldn't I think it even though they're

Segment 18 (108.64s - 113.12s)
 supposed to do it? So the question is, why was I blocking it? Why were other people blocking it?

Segment 19 (113.12s - 118.8s)
 Why can I say I'll take my steak medium rare? I need size six shoes, but I won't say, would you

Segment 20 (118.8s - 124.96s)
 praise me this way? And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where

Segment 21 (124.96s - 131.36s)
 I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you, my inner circle,

Segment 22 (131.36s - 136.16s)
 like you're the enemy. Because what can you do with that data? You couldn't neglect me?

Segment 23 (136.88s - 142.0s)
 You could abuse it or you could actually meet my need. And I took my bike into the bike store.

Segment 24 (142.0s - 146.4s)
 I love this same bike and they do something called truing the wheels. The guy said, you know,

Segment 25 (146.4s - 150.32s)
 when you true the wheels it's going to make the bike so much better. I get the same bike back

Segment 26 (150.32s - 154.64s)
 and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years

Segment 27 (154.64s - 160.8s)
 and my bike is like new. So I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels. Be

Segment 28 (160.8s - 165.84s)
 honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife,

Segment 29 (165.84s - 170.56s)
 go ask her what does she need? Go home to your husband. What does he need? Go home and ask those

Segment 30 (170.56s - 174.56s)
 questions and then help the people around you. And it's simple. Why and why should we care about

Segment 31 (174.56s - 178.88s)
 this? We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures, different

Segment 32 (178.88s - 184.72s)
 languages? I think it starts household by household under the same roof. So let's make it right in

Segment 33 (184.72s - 188.48s)
 our own backyard. Now I wanted to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands,

Segment 34 (188.48s - 193.36s)
 great mothers, friends, daughters, sons. And maybe somebody's never said that to you but you've

Segment 35 (193.36s - 198.64s)
 done a really, really good job. And thank you for being here and just showing up and changing

Segment 36 (198.64s - 201.92s)
 the world with your ideas. Thank you.

Segment 37 (201.92s - 223.84s)
 In the beginning was a screen. Millions of us came together in a public place

Segment 38 (223.84s - 235.92s)
 to understand the present, to see visions of the future, sharing emotions, sharing experiences,

Segment 39 (235.92s - 250.64s)
 it shaped our lives. Then there was a second screen. He connected us to our world and even to other worlds.

Segment 40 (251.6s - 261.2s)
 It gave us amazing games to play. He made us think and got us talking. But although this is

Segment 41 (261.2s - 268.88s)
 a world we could all share, the experience itself was becoming private. Then came a third screen.

Segment 42 (269.52s - 275.6s)
 The change the way we worked at play. It became part of something much bigger, the internet

Segment 43 (276.56s - 282.96s)
 and a revolution happened. We could play new games and new ways, find new music in new places,

Segment 44 (283.6s - 289.92s)
 new communities, new kinds of communities emerged. With the experience of becoming individual,

Segment 45 (290.56s - 298.8s)
 even solitary, the sense of community felt real but it was virtual. And then everything changed.

Segment 46 (299.28s - 308.0s)
 And it changed forever. Everything came to us in a device that fit into our pocket. We went back out

Segment 47 (308.0s - 314.56s)
 into the world. We listened to what we loved, when we liked. We played when we wanted, where we chose.

Segment 48 (315.2s - 320.8s)
 We shared what inspired us with everyone we cared about. We carried our sense of purpose with us.

Segment 49 (321.52s - 327.2s)
 We discovered new people and places and experiences. And our sense of purpose kept growing.

Segment 50 (327.2s - 335.76s)
 It was the end of something. It was the beginning of everything. Welcome to the fourth screen.
